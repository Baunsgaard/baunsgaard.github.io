# Sebastian Baunsgaard

Sebastian Baunsgaard is a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science (ISDS) at
[Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home/), Graz, Austria.
His primarily research focus is exploiting data structures in linear algebra programs.
Sebastian is a frequent contributor to open source code,
and is a PMC member in [Apache SystemDS](https://systemds.apache.org/)
with contributions ranging from high level compilation techniques to low level tight loop optimization of kernels.
Sebastian received his bachelor and masters from [ITU Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/)
in the subject of [speech recognition](https://dasya.itu.dk/for-students/projects/archive/speechrecognition/).
Currently he is a member of [DAMS Lab](https://damslab.github.io/) headed by [Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/).
