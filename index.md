## mail: seb\[AD\]bgaard.dk

Sebastian Baunsgaard is a Ph.D. student at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/).
Sebastian previously studied at the [Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science (ISDS)](https://www.tugraz.at/institutes/isds/home/) at
[Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home/), Austria.
His primarily research focus is exploiting data structures in linear algebra programs.
Sebastian is a frequent contributor to open source code,
and is a PMC member in [Apache SystemDS](https://systemds.apache.org/)
with contributions ranging from high level compilation techniques to low level tight loop optimization of kernels.
Sebastian received his bachelor and masters from [ITU Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/) specializing in advanced computing
with a dissertation in the subject of [speech recognition](https://dasya.itu.dk/for-students/projects/archive/speechrecognition/).
Before starting his Ph.D. Sebastian worked with automatic test setup and installation of high-end cameras in [Phase One](https://www.phaseone.com/),
and full stack web development in [Zen Data Aps](https://zendata.dk/).
Currently he is a member of [DAMS Lab](https://damslab.github.io/) headed and supervised by [Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/).
